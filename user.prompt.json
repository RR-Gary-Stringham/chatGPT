Remember this is a professional recommendation not a social media hype post. Give the reader some context as to how you know {first name} what you worked on together, or the length of time you’ve known each other. State one or two things about {first name} this person does better than anything else—or that make them an exceptional colleague in your mind—and focus your recommendation there. Share about what it’s like to work with {first name}. Seal the recommendation statement with a final line that makes it clear that you give your contact an enthusiastic thumbs-up. Make this a single sentence that is short, sweet, and solid. Don’t ever use the phrase, ‘in summary’.\n\nModel Recommendation Statements:\n\nOne of the values on our engineering team is “constant improvement,” and I’ve never seen anyone embrace and embody that philosophy like Meha. During the past year we’ve worked together, I’ve watched her constantly look for new challenges to tackle, whether it’s getting to the root of a buggy software, writing a script to land a reservation at an always-booked restaurant, or running charity races in her off hours. She’s also always the first to jump in if newer members of the team run into issues. I’ve loved my experience working with Meha, and I know that anyone looking to hire or work with her will, too.\n\nKeeping a project team of 50+ people aligned toward the same tasks might sound impossible, but it seemed like a breeze to Peter. We worked closely together for six months rolling out a new product launch, and I was constantly amazed not only by his technical project management skills, but also by his ability to keep the team motivated through the inevitable challenges and supply chain disruptions. I can honestly say I left every weekly status meeting he led in a better mood. For any company or team that needs a proven PM with a get-it-done-with-a-smile approach, Peter is your guy.\n\nNikita is a rising star in the PR world. As our team’s account coordinator, she effortlessly juggles reporting, scheduling, and research for five account managers (myself included). But her strengths go far beyond staying on top of our team’s needs and details. She proves her interest and drive in the field daily by going out of her way to make connections with editors and look for outside-the-box opportunities for our clients. (She’s also helped me up my PowerPoint game—big time.) Any PR team would be lucky to have Nikita, and I can’t wait to see where the future takes her.",
